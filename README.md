# InheritanceLab

InheritanceLab is a project created to showcase various aspects of inheritance in object-oriented programming. This project explores different inheritance types, accommodating simple inheritance, multiple inheritance, and procedural inheritance. InheritanceLab is designed to be an educational resource for developers that want to learn and understand how inheritance works in practice.

## Project Overview

InheritanceLab is developed using C#. The project structure comprises the main *InheritanceLab.sln* file supported by the *InheritanceLab* folder containing the source code. In the project, various inheritance scenarios are explored, helping you get a better understanding of how classes can extend other classes and use their properties, as well as how inheritance can lead to a more modular and maintainable codebase.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thisisyoussef/InheritanceLab.git
   ```
2. Open the *InheritanceLab.sln* file within Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution by selecting **Build -> Build Solution** from the menu.
4. Run the project by pressing **F5** or clicking the **Start** button.

## Usage Guide

After successfully building and running the project, you can study the code and analyze the different inheritance scenarios implemented within the project. This is meant for educational purposes, so it is suggested to go through each part of the code and understand how inheritance works in a general sense and observe its benefits in terms of code organization and maintainability.

## Features and Functionality

The project showcases the following inheritance scenarios:

1. Simple Inheritance - Demonstrates how a class can explicitly inherit from a parent (base) class.
2. Multiple Inheritance - Illustrates a workaround for inheriting from multiple classes, which C# does not support directly.
3. Procedural Inheritance - Shows how classes can inherit base-class behavior through aggregation and delegation.

By exploring these scenarios, you gain insight into how inheritance works in numerous situations and learn valuable coding practices for designing complex, extensible, and maintainable codebases.

**Technologies and Tools Used**: InheritanceLab is built using C# and Visual Studio. C# is a powerful and versatile programming language from Microsoft, and Visual Studio is an excellent integrated development environment (IDE) for developing C# applications. The project leverages the object-oriented paradigm to explore inheritance, thus demonstrating practical ways to apply inheritance in real-world projects. The choice of C# and Visual Studio guarantees high performance, efficient, and maintainable code, which proves advantageous in terms of scalability, readability, and overall project success.
